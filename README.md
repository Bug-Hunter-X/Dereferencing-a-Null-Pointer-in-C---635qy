# Dereferencing a Null Pointer in C++

This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: dereferencing a null pointer.  The code attempts to write to an invalid memory address, resulting in a segmentation fault or crash.  The solution shows how to prevent this by adding a null check before dereferencing.
